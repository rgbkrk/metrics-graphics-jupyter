# metrics-graphics-jupyter
[Metrics Graphics](http://metricsgraphicsjs.org/) for the Jupyter Notebook.

[MetricsGraphics.js](http://metricsgraphicsjs.org/) is a stellar little graphing library built on top of D3, which I'd like to expose as a plotting interface through Jupyter/IPython widgets.

:warning: This is a work in progress (and doesn't work quite yet), so this will be in flux until ready for a real release.
